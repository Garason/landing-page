	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		I’m an aspiring software developer transitioning from high-skill technical work into programming. My background in advanced tree climbing, rigging, and safety-critical operations taught me precision, discipline, and the ability to solve problems under pressure — the same mindset I now bring to writing clean, reliable code. I’m currently sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python through hands-on projects, with the goal of building software people can depend on every day.

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    My professional background spans military leadership, technical rigging, logistics, and complex 
    operations management. Across these high-stakes environments, I developed strengths that translate 
    directly into software development: breaking down complex systems, managing workflows, solving 
    problems under pressure, and communicating clearly within a team. These experiences built the 
    foundation for my transition into full-stack development. Today, I apply the same disciplined, 
    methodical approach to writing clean code, analyzing requirements, and building reliable digital 
    solutions.
