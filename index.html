      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an aspiring software developer transitioning from high-skill technical work into programming.
        My background in advanced tree climbing, rigging, and safety-critical operations taught me precision,
        discipline,</br> and the ability to solve problems under pressure — the same mindset I now bring to writing
        clean, reliable code. I’m currently sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python through
        hands-on projects, with the goal of building software people can depend on every day.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My professional background spans military leadership, technical rigging, logistics, and complex
        operations management. Across these high-stakes environments, I developed strengths that translate
        directly into software</p></br> development: breaking down complex systems, managing workflows, solving
        problems under pressure, and communicating clearly within a team. These experiences built the
        foundation for my transition into full-stack development. Today, I apply the same disciplined,
        methodical approach to writing clean code, analyzing requirements, and building reliable digital
        solutions.
